# eARth

eARth is a platform for artists to create interactive 3D models and place them in various places around the world using location-based AR. Models may contain mp3 audio files that can be listened to once a spectator is within the model’s radius.

eARth’s goal is to empower artists and create a new way for people to appreciate art around the world.
